 added remove and in order predecessor function needed for the two children case
 for the remove funtion, it no longer needs the parent parameter as the remove funtion itself will raise a notfound error 
   the if/else for the notfound error may need to be looked at just to confirm it's in the right place. Also the errors are just listed as a comment

  added Word.h for storing words and their counts
    added operator overloads we should need and added ++ and -- to make counting words easier. 
  Fixed a couple of small bugs with code that was pulled from previous projects and such
  I plan to go through later and fix a lot of main with more up to date and relevant code.
