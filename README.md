 added remove and in order predecessor function needed for the two children case
 for the remove funtion, it no longer needs the parent parameter as the remove funtion itself will raise a notfound error 
   the if/else for the notfound error may need to be looked at just to confirm it's in the right place. Also the errors are just listed as a comment
